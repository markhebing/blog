**About Me** Currently studying coding and looking to developing a second professional career. Interested in learning how to develop applications used to automate anything and everything from websites to robots. Eventually, I would like to freelance remotely and perhaps develop and sell my own websites and apps. I have included a link to a database of python scripts I have personally written that are based around function building as well as scientific and engineering scripts, artificial intelligence, and data mining.
