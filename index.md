<img align = "left" src = "https://markhebing.github.io/images/MarkHebing33.jpeg" alt="Mark Hebing">**About:**  I am an analytical and physical chemist by trade working for [Linde PLC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linde_plc). Currently studying coding and looking to develop scientific and engineering applications specific to the energy and chemical industries.

Interested in learning how to code applications used to automate everything from interactive websites to analytical instrumentation and robots for fun.

I have personally found coding to be both challenging and rewarding and a very diverse field of study, much like chemistry.

I have included a link to a growing repository of [simple python scripts](https://github.com/markhebing/python-scripts) as well as a growing repository of [HTML embeded javascipts](https://github.com/markhebing/javascripts) that I have personally written that are based around function building as well as scientific and engineering calculations, as well as a small amount of artificial intelligence and data mining.

**Sidenote:** I am fascinated by both computer architecture as well coding logic due to the notable parallels I have found between advanced quantum physics / boolean logic, chemistry / machine code, biology / artificial intelligence ... Of specific relevance are dark matter physics.

**Special Interests:** Analytical Chemistry, Phase Behavior, Chemical Physics, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Physics, Mass Uptake Isotope Physics, Quark Architecture, Fermionic Condensate, Ultraviolet Cloaking, Dark Matter Binary Mass Logic
