<img align = "left" src = "https://markhebing.github.io/images/MarkHebing33.jpeg" alt="Mark Hebing">**About:**  I am an analytical and physical chemist by trade working for [Linde PLC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linde_plc). Currently studying coding and looking to develop scientific and engineering applications specific to the energy and chemical industries.

Interested in learning how to code applications used to automate everything.

I have personally found coding to be both challenging and rewarding and a very diverse field of study, much like chemistry.

I have included a link to a growing repository of [simple python scripts](https://github.com/markhebing/python-scripts) as well as a growing repository of [HTML embeded javascipts](https://github.com/markhebing/javascripts) that I have personally written that are based around function building as well as scientific and engineering calculations, as well as a small amount of artificial intelligence and data mining.

**Sidenote:** I am fascinated by both computer architecture as well coding logic due to the notable parallels I have found between advanced quantum physics / boolean logic, chemistry / machine code, biology / artificial intelligence ... Of specific relevance are dark matter physics.

**Special Interests:** Analytical Chemistry, Phase Behavior, Chemical Physics, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Physics, Mass Uptake Isotope Physics, Quark Architecture, Fermionic Condensate, Ultraviolet Cloaking, Dark Matter Binary Mass Logic
